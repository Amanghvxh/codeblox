  "master_plan": "This React-based blog platform uses Firebase Firestore for managing blog posts, allowing users to create, view, update, and delete posts. The **Src** folder contains core files, with **Components** like **Header.js**, **Footer.js**, **PostList.js**, and **Post.js** handling UI elements. **Pages** include **HomePage.js** (landing page) and **PostPage.js** (post details), both set as routes. The **Firebase** folder houses **Firebase.js** (setup), **AddPost.js** (add posts), **GetPosts.js** (fetch posts), **UpdatePost.js** (update posts), and **DeletePost.js** (delete posts). **Global.css** in **Styles** manages global styling. **App.js** is the root component for routing, and **Index.js** is the entry point. The app's flow: users land on **HomePage**, view posts, navigate to **PostPage** for details, with all CRUD operations done via Firebase."
